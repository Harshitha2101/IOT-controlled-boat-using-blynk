# IOT-controlled-boat-using-blynk
The project involves creating a wireless boat controlled via the Blynk app, utilizing an ESP32
development board. The boat's propulsion system, comprising two DC motors for the
propellers, is managed by an L298N motor driver. Power is supplied and controlled by a
rechargeable battery and switch integrated into the system.
A C++ program is developed in the Arduino
IDE and subsequently uploaded to the ESP32 development board. This program enables the
boat to establish a Wi-Fi connection for communication with the Blynk app. All operational
commands are then transmitted seamlessly through the Blynk app interface, facilitating
remote control and monitoring of the boat's movements and functions.
